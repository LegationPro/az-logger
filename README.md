<h1>Az Logger</h1>

A simple, color-coded, file-based logging package for Go applications.


<h2>Overview</h2>

This package provides a logger with various log levels (`Debug`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, `Panic`, `Fatal`). It logs messages to files named by their log levels and supports color-coded output to the terminal for easier reading.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To use this logger in your project, import the package:

```go
import "github.com/LegationPro/go-logger/logger"
```

<h1>Usage</h1>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

Before logging any messages, you need to initialize the logger. This can be done by calling NewLogger() with the path where the log files will be stored.

```go
logger.NewLogger("logs")
```

<h2>Logging Messages</h2>
You can log messages at different levels using the following methods:

  - `Debug(message string)`

  - `Info(message string)`

  - `Warn(message string)`

  - `Error(message string)`

  - `Panic(message string)`

  - `Fatal(message string)`

<h3>Example:</h3>

```go
logger.GetLogger().Debug("This is a debug message")
logger.GetLogger().Info("This is an info message")
```

<h2>Cleaning Logs</h2>

To clean (truncate) all log files, you can use the `Clean()` method:

```go
logger.GetLogger().Clean()
```

<h2>Example</h2>
Here's a complete example of using the logger:

```go
package main

import "github.com/LegationPro/go-logger/logger"

func main() {
    // Initialize the logger
    logger.NewLogger("logs")

    // Log messages of different levels
    logger.GetLogger().Debug("Debug message")
    logger.GetLogger().Info("Info message")
    logger.GetLogger().Warn("Warning message")
    logger.GetLogger().Error("Error message")
    logger.GetLogger().Panic("Panic message")
    logger.GetLogger().Fatal("Fatal message")

    // Clean up log files
    logger.GetLogger().Clean()
}
```
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

<h3>Log Levels</h3>

The package defines the following log levels:

- Debug
- Info
- Warn
- Error
- Panic
- Fatal

Each level corresponds to a specific color output in the terminal and a dedicated log file.

<h2>Log Files</h2>

Log files are created in the directory specified when initializing the logger. Each file is named according to its log level (e.g., `debug.log`, `info.log`).

Color Output
Messages are color-coded based on their log level using the `fatih/color` package:

- Debug: Cyan
- Info: Green
- Warn: Yellow
- Error: Red
- Panic: Bright Red
- Fatal: Magenta

<h2>File Permissions</h2>

The log directory and files are created with permissions **0755**.
